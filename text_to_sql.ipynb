Imagine asking a database a question like you would a colleague, and getting the exact SQL command you need. This tool does just that! It uses AI models, such as those provided by OpenAI, to understand your question and then creates the SQL query for you. It's designed to be user-friendly and secure, ensuring that you can access only the necessary data in your database. This makes data analysis and retrieval straightforward, even if you're not a SQL expert."
